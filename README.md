# Documenting Your Project With Sphinx

This is my work on Brandon Rhodes' Sphinx tutorial. I originally ran
across his [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNHM7q2hLh8)
on YouTube. The original source files for the tutorial came from his
[GitHub
repository](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/sphinx-tutorial.git) for
the tutorial. The tutorial can be cloned it with the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/sphinx-tutorial.git

## From Brandon's Original README.rst

Welcome\!

This repository contains all of the course materials that support the
tutorial that Brandon Rhodes presented at PyCon every year from 2010
through 2013.

The final 2013 version of the tutorial was recorded and can be watched
in its entirety at the pyvideo.org:
